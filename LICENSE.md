The majority of this repository is Reloaded II's mod template.
The DATMAGIC.BIN is from the game, but modified by Warden to have the correct model instead of the prototype one.
Warden also provided the memory locations and values they needed to be changed to.
I put this into code, made it work with Reloaded II, and drew the Preview image.
Anything by me is under the [WTFPL-69.420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sean-clayton/WTFPL-69.420/master/WTFPL-69.420.txt) license.
Warden says that there is no license needed from the user either, so do what you want.
